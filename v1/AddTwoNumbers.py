# You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers. The digits are stored 
# in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and 
# return it as a linked list (also in reverse order).

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

# Solution:
# Build the linked list (from head to tail) one number at a time, making 
# sure to account for the carry for each number and after building the whole
# list.
