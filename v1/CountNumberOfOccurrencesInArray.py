# Solution: Implement a modified version of binary search as follows. At
# each step of the recursion, calculate the middle index. If the element
# at that index matches the target element, update the lowest and highest
# indices at which you've seen the target element before and recurse into
# both halves of the array (exclusing the middle element). If the target
# element is less than the middle element, recurse into the left subarray.
# Else, recurse into the right subarray. Once you have the lowest and
# highest indices at which you've seen the element, there are 3 cases.
# 1) low = float('inf'), this means you've never seen the element and
# want to return 0. 2) low == high, this means the element showed up once
# and you want to return 1. 3) low and high are different numbers, so you
# want to return their difference plus 1. Time complexity is O(log(n)),
# since you're throwing half of the array away at each step in the
# recursion, and space complexity is O(1).
