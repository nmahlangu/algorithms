# Solution: Throw the head of each list into a Priority Queue. While the queue is not empty,
# pop and append the next element to the tail of the new linked list, making sure to throw it's
# next element into the priority queue when it is taken out. Time complexity is O(nklog(k)),
# where n is the number of lists and k is the length of the longest list, and
# space complexity is O(n) (since priority queue is storing at most n nodes)
