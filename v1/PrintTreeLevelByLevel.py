# Perform BFS, keeping a dummy element in the queue of nodes to visit. Whenever the dummy
# is dequeued, print a newline and place the dummy back at the end of the queue (unless it's
# empty meaning there are no more nodes to visit and the traversal is done). For all other
# elements that are dequeued, enqueue all of it's children and print the parent (without
# a newline).
