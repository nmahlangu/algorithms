# We know the bounds of numbers that [a,b] can be in are [0,sqrt(c)],
# so initialize a as 1 and b as sqrt(q). Repeat the following until b < a. 
# Compute the sum of a^2 + b^2. If it's less than c, increment a. If it's 
# greater than target, decrement b. If it's equal to c, return (a,b).
# Time complexity is O(sqrt(c)) and space complexity is O(1).
