# You're given an address book which contains a list of contacts combined
# from different sources. Each contact has 1 or more email addresses.
# Your job is to write a function that groups together all contacts which
# share any email together.
# 
# For example, given the following input:
#   c1: nickm@harvard.edu, nick@gmail.com
#   c2: malcolm@harvard.edu
#   c3: nick@gmail.com, nickmahlangu@yahoo.com
#   c4: nickmahlangu@yahoo.com
#   c5: malcolm@harvard.edu
#   c6: allison@harvard.edu
# The solution would be:
# [(c1,c3,c4), (c2,c5), (c6)]

# Good solution: Consider each contact a node and an edge exists between 2 nodes
# if they share at least 1 email. Using this representation, each connected component
# will be 1 group. Implementation-wise, run DFS from every node, making sure to keep
# track of any element that's been seen so far. Because DFS will return None if the
# root has been seen, filter out empty groups. Time complexity is O(v+e), where 'v' is
# the number of nodes and 'e' is the number of edges.

# Best solution: Use a disjoint-set data structure with union by rank and path compression.
# Time complexity is amortized O(v), where 'v' is the total number of emails in all contacts,
# and space compexity is O(n), where n is the number of contacts.
#
# Notes: In this data structure, each set is represented by a tree, so that each element points
# to a parent in the tree. Furthermore, the root of the tree will point to itself. To keep
# trees short, we two heuristics known as union by rank and path compression. In union by rank,
# each element initially has a rank of 0. When 2 elements are unioned together (call them A and B),
# one of two things happens: if they have the same rank, point B's root's parent pointer at A and
# increment A's rank by 1; if they have different rank, point the shorter one's root's parent pointer
# at the longer one's root. In path compression, the idea is that once we perform a find on some
# element, we should adjust its parent pointer so that it points directly to the root. That way, if
# we ever do another find on it, we start out much closer to the root.
