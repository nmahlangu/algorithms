# Solution: The X-order part is describing where in the traversal you
# do, in this case, the printing. So in pre- you do it before both nodes,
# in in- you do it between both nodes, and in post- you do it after both
# nodes. Use a stack to keep track of nodes that need to be visited.
# 
# Iterative:
# The time complexity of each of these implementations is O(v), where v 
# is the number of edges, and the space complexity is O(v) (since in the 
# worst case you hold every vertex in your stack).
#
# Recursive:
# The time complexity of each of these implementations is O(v), where v
# is the number of edges, and the space complexity is O(h), where h is
# the maximal depth of the tree (this space will be used in memory
# stack space, not a stack data structure like the iterative implementations).

# Solution: Handle the current node and then use then append it's children
# to the queue being used to keep track of which nodes to visit next. Time
# complexity is O(v), where v is the number of vertices in the binary tree,
# and space complexity is O(v) (since worst case you're holding every vertex
# in the queue).
