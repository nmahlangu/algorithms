# Solution: To rotate the image left 90 degrees, first transpose
# the image and then reverse the order of the rows. To rotate the
# image right 90 degrees, first transpose the image and then reverse
# the order of the columns. Time complexity is O(n^2), since touching
# each element once during transposition and once during row/column
# swap, and space complexity is O(1), since you can do everything
# in place.
